            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination.Education originated as the
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and
                complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Educational transformation refers to systemic changes in the prevailing
                educational model. Distinguishing itself from the theories that defend reforms or renovations of some
                elements of the model, maintaining the substance of the traditional teaching and learning process, and
                its organization and structure.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Lets Grow Together.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">There are different ways to categorize education, for example by age or
                subject. One way is to divide it into formal education, non-formal education, and informal education.

                Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small
                children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school
                and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a
                college or university which may grant an academic degree. Or, students may go to a City college where
                they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to be plumbers, electricians,
                builders and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to get practical
                experience. Apprenticeship was the older way to do this. </p>
